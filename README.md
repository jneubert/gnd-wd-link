# gnd-wd-link

Use and improve links from the [Integrated Authority File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Authority_File) (GND) to Wikidata.

Currently, a keyboard macro script for Windows, which takes you from an highlighted GND ID in any text to a browser window with the Wikidata item, which has that GND ID as an external identifier.

Requires the installation of [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
