# gnd-wd-link

Use and improve links from the [Integrated Authority File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Authority_File) (GND) to Wikidata.

Currently, a simple [keyboard macro](ahk/open_wd.ahk) for Windows, which takes you from a selected/highlighted GND ID in any text to a browser window with the Wikidata item, which has that GND ID as an external identifier.

Requires the installation of [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). Builds on the [Wikidata Resolver](https://tools.wmflabs.org/wikidata-todo/resolver.php) service.
